##Function to evaluate the objective functions for the given input vector x. x is an array of decision variables 
##and f(1), f(2), etc are the objective functions. The algorithm always minimizes the objective function hence if 
##you would like to maximize the function then multiply the function by negative one. M is the numebr of objective 
##functions and V is the number of decision variables.

##This functions is basically written by the user who defines his/her own objective function. Make sure that the M 
##and V matches your initial user input.

##An example objective function is given below. It has two six decision variables are two objective functions.

##Number of objective is two, while it can have arbirtarly many decision
##variables within the range -5 and 5. Common number of variables is 3.
