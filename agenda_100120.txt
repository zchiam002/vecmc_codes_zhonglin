Done: 
1. GA
2. NSGA_II
3. RL 

16/02/2020 agenda:
Fix the MILP implementation
	- slave only implementation
 	- got to make the model simple enough, such that it can be solved solely using the slave.

Fix the lineariztaion models 
Fix the simulation models at the component level 
Fix the sliding window technique interface 
Fix the RL interface
