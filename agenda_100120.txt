Key developments:
1. tighten up the RL models 
2. do the sliding window interface 
3. finish the individual models 
4. do up the regression models for getting the values for the chiller 
5. do up the documentation



Decomposition approach for holistic optimization 
Sliding-window coupled multi-objective optimization

new agenda:
1. Mono ga 
2. multi ga 
3. MILP
4. RL 
5. Sliding window
